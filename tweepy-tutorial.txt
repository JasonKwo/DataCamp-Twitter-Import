In order to acces the twitter API you will need to create a twitter account and login to twitter apps and create a new app.

Go to the keys and access tab and copy
API KEY
API SECRET
ACESS TOKEN
ACCESS TOKEN SECRET

For this task we will be using DataCamps example key/token credentials

Twitter has a number of APIs, including:
Twitter's REST (representational state transfer) API allows users to read and write twitter data.
The streaming APIs give developers low latency access to Twitter's global stream of tweet data.

A proper implementation of a streaming client will be pushed messages indicating tweets and other events have occurred,
without any of the overhead associated with polling a REST endpoint.  


Public streams:  Streams of public data flowing through Twitter.  Suitable for following specific users or topics,
and data mining

User streams:  Single-user steams, containing roughly all of the data corresponding witha single user's view of Twitter

Site streams:  The multi-user version of user streams.  Site streams are intended for servers which must connect to Twitter
on behalf of many users.


In this project we will be using the GET statuses/sample, which returns a small random sample of all public statuses.
The tweets returned by the default access level are the same, so if two different clients connect to this endpoint they
will see the same tweets.  If you wanted to return ALL public status, you would need to access Twitter's FIREHOSE API, which
requires business purchasing/access (expensive).

Tweepy has an OAUTH handler, so we simply need to pass the access token/secret.

We will need to define a twitter stream listener class.

Hugo's defined a tweet listener, which creates a file 'tweets.txt', collects streaming tweets and writes them to 'tweets.txt'.
Once 100 tweets have been collected, the user closes the connection and stops listening.
